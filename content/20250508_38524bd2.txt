Fanatical just kicked off Bundlefest Spring 2025, and this iteration of the popular PC game promotion looks to be the biggest yet. Past Bundlefests started on Mondays and ran for five days. Typically, Fanatical introduced one new bundle each day, but occasionally there were days with two bundle offers. This time around, Bundlefest started on a Wednesday (May 7) and runs through Friday, May 16. New bundles will go live each weekday, meaning there will be at least eight new game bundles total during Bundlefest Spring 2025. Kicking things off is a new Killer Bundle with five roguelike action games $5. The next new bundle is scheduled to go live on Thursday, May 8, at 8 AM PT / 11 AM ET. You can check out what's included in the new Killer Bundle below, and be sure to check back tomorrow for the latest deal. It's worth noting that while Bundlefest Spring 2025 only lasts through Friday, May 16, the new bundles launched during the event will be available for several more weeks after. We've made sure to list when each bundle deal expires below. Disclosure: GameSpot and Fanatical are both owned by Fandom. This new edition of Fanatical's recurring Killer Bundle gets you five roguelike action games for just $5. The titles included are the wave-based FPS brawler Paint the Town Red, top-down survival shooter Empty Shell, medieval survivors-like Army of Ruin, the Hades-inspired deck-building dungeon crawler Dandy Ace, and the sci-fi tower defense game DG2: Defense Grid. That tallies up to a $75 value for all five games, meaning you're saving $70 thanks to this $5 bundle deal. All five games in the bundle are delivered as official Steam keys, and each is Steam Deck verified. The Killer Bundle (Bundlefest Spring 2025) will be available until June 11.
