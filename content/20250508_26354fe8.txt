Nintendo Switch 2 GameChat sessions could be monitored and recorded by Nintendo for safety reasons, the company revealed via a new update to its privacy policy. As spotted on Reddit, the Japanese company recently made an update to their privacy policy ahead of the release of their next-generation system, adding a clause stating that Nintendo may collect, monitor, and record audio and video of GameChat sessions to "provide a safe and secure environment" for some of their services. While the new privacy policy clause does not specify if GameChat sessions will constantly be monitored and recorded, it's still a bit concerning to know that any session could be recorded for whatever reason, though other similar services also have similar security measures in place. GameChat is one of the new features supported by the Nintendo Switch 2 over its predecessor. With it, up to 12 players will be able to chat while playing games, share their screen in real time, even if they are playing different games, and see other players with a compatible USB-C camera. To use the feature, players will need an active Nintendo Switch Online membership, although the feature will be available for free until March 31st, 2026. The Nintendo Switch 2 console launches worldwide, with a few exceptions, on June 5th worldwide.
