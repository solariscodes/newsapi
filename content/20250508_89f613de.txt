Control 2, the next big single-player game from Remedy, will be made on a smaller budget than its last single-player feature, Alan Wake 2, chief executive officer Tero Virtala confirmed. In an interview with Game File, Virtala spoke about how this will be done, and how it's about Remedy learning from past mistakes to go "from surviving to succeeding." Virtala says that â‚¬50 million is what he thinks the studio needs to make a good Remedy game, and that's the budget Control 2 has, which is slightly less than what Alan Wake 2 cost to make. Remedy has always been known for creating exceptional single-player experiences that have critics raving about them, but they're never able to achieve the massive commercial success that other single-player games of the same ilk can achieve. Even Alan Wake 2, for example, only recently surpassed 2 million copies sold since its 2023 launch. That's not to say 2 million isn't a huge milestone, but it makes you scratch your head when you think about the fact that Alan Wake 2 is widely agreed to be one of the best single-player games and narrative experiences in video games in years. It gave Baldur's Gate III a real run for its money when everyone thought Baldur's Gate was a shoo-in for game of the year. And yet, Alan Wake 2 is well behind Baldur's Gate III's 15+ million copies sold. It's not surprising, therefore, to learn that Remedy is looking to streamline its process, so it can still make the kinds of games it is renowned for, without fear that it won't survive. Control 2 is currently in full production, but in the meantime, Remedy's next game will be FBC Firebreak, a cooperative multiplayer game set within the world of Control, which is due out next month on June 17, 2025, on PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC.
