Minecraft has hundreds of possible blocks you can use to create structures or spruce up your base. If you're looking for something close to real life, then Bricks might be what you're after. However, Bricks are crafted using a different process from most other blocks, so it can be confusing when learning how to acquire them. Below, you can see how to craft Bricks and some of their involved recipes in Minecraft. Technically, there are two kinds of Bricks in Minecraft. One is an actual "Brick," a cube-like item resembling a real-life brick. The other is called "Bricks," which is the block that you're used to seeing. You need the smaller Brick to create the Bricks block, so you can see the exact recipe to craft both below: Brick Recipe Bricks Recipe As the Bricks block is made using four Brick, you only need to know how to make the Brick itself. Fortunately, it only requires one resource, which is Clay Balls. Clay Balls can be obtained by breaking a Clay block. Clay blocks are sparsely found across Minecraft worlds, but their main locations are in Lush Caves or in shallow water. Every Clay block you destroy yields four Clay Balls. It's easiest to destroy a Clay block with a shovel, but you can use any tool you have available. More Minecraft Guides: Once you have the Clay Balls, place them in the top box of a furnace and then place a fuel source in the bottom box. The simplest fuel source to use is coal, but you can use anything else you have as well. If you have enough Clay Balls and fuel, I suggest using several furnaces and dispersing the resources across all the furnaces to speed up the process of acquiring Brick. Then, with the Brick you receive, you can use four of them in a crafting table to create a single Bricks block. The most difficult part of the Brick-making process is trying to find Clay blocks to acquire Clay Balls. However, as long as you check caves and water sources, you should be able to find enough to make enough Bricks for your needs in Minecraft.
