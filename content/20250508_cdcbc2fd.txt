Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 developer Sandfall Interactive has revealed that it'll release a patch this week that will tone down one of the more popular builds from the game. Expedition 33 has a robust system for buildcrafting, and one of them turns the character Maelle into a weapon of mass destruction. It's primarily an endgame build that revolves around the Stendhal skill, and when done correctly, it's capable of eliminating enemies in a single blow. In an update on its social media channels, Sandfall says that Stendhal was "underwhelming for most of development" and that it was boosted before Expedition 33 was released. "We still want you to be able to break the game--and you absolutely still can--but Stendhal was making it a bit too easy," Sandfall wrote.

This build does require quite a bit of work up front before you can use it, as you'll need to acquire a specific weapon and several passive Pictos skills to maximize the damage output. It's not uncommon to smash through enemies who have health bars in the range of 50 million, and several players have managed to optimize the build to deal billions in damage. Even with the surprise launch of Oblivion Remastered just days before it was scheduled to arrive, Expedition 33 continues to be one of the big hits of 2025. The game has sold over 2 million copies across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, and it was also a day-one launch through Game Pass. The soundtrack is also performing exceptionally well, as it reached No. 1 on Billboard's Classical Album charts, and it has been streamed over 18 million times since it went live.
