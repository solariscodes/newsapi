Genshin Impact developer HoYoverse (previously known as miHoYo) announced that United States players will have to verify their age soon to continue playing the game. Here's the brief message shared with the community: Dear Travelers， We are required by law to age verify US player accounts. The age verification process will be rolled out to all US players by May 20th while login (if already have one) or account registration. Please ensure to provide your age information by July 18th, 2025. Failure to verify will result in: - Account suspension - In-game friends and chat records will be deleted - No further notifications post-suspension due to inaccessible account information as required by law If the verification is not completed by July 20th, 2026, the personal information of your HoYoverse account will be deleted permanently. This appears to be a direct consequence of a recent settlement with the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which had charged HoYoverse with deceiving minors into spending for their loot boxes. The Chinese developer was subsequently banned from selling them to users under 16 without a parent's express consent, paid a $20 million fine to the FTC, and was also subject to the following stipulations: Samuel Levine, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said at the time: Genshin Impact deceived children, teens, and other players into spending hundreds of dollars on prizes they stood little chance of winning. Companies that deploy these dark-pattern tactics will be held accountable if they deceive players, particularly kids and teens, about the true costs of in-game transactions. The popular free-to-play action RPG is being updated today to patch 5.6. Dubbed 'Paralogism', it features two new characters, the five-star support character Escoffier and the four-star DPS character Ifa. There is also a new Archon Quest, a new Story Quest, and a new Boss fight, among other additions to Genshin Impact.
