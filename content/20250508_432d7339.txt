Grand Theft Auto VI is going to massively surpass its predecessor in pretty much every area, judging from a new early comparison video. The new video, shared on YouTube by GRIZZLY BEAR, is based on the game's second trailer shared online yesterday and does an excellent job highlighting the massive jump the new entry in the series will offer in terms of character detail, environments, visuals, and even special effects like explosions. You can check out the comparison right below. Following the surprise release of the game's second trailer, Rockstar Games also launched the official Grand Theft Auto VI website, which provided some additional information on the two main characters, Lucia and Jason, and the new rendition of the iconic Vice City, which is said to offer something different in each neighborhood. Besides Vice City, players will also be able to explore a few other locations, like the tropical archipelago of Leonida Keys, the coast of Port Gellhorn, the industrial area of Ambrosia, and others. Long scheduled for a Fall 2025 launch on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S, Grand Theft Auto VI was officially delayed last week, and will now release on May 26th, 2026, worldwide. The game was unsurprisingly delayed to allow the developer to deliver the quality fans expect to see in the highly anticipated game.
