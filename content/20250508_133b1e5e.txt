After quite a stretch of silence, Bethesda Game Studios has released a Starfield Beta update (version 1.15.214) on Steam. Any owner of the game can download it simply by clicking on the game in their digital library, selecting Properties, then Betas, and picking the beta build from the drop-down menu. Here's the full changelog shared by the development team: Of course, this isn't such a significant update to convince players to return to Starfield. Still, fans of the game are hoping Bethesda can continue improving the sci-fi roleplaying game beyond the Shattered Space expansion that was released last year. That's what the developer teased a couple of months ago through social media channels, hinting that 'exciting things' would be added to the game later in 2025. The announcement might come during the Xbox Games Showcase, which is set for June 8.
