The Talos Principle: Reawakened remastered the original 2014 puzzle classic and its Road to Gehenna expansion with an Unreal Engine 5 upgrade, but it also went further than that. It included a whole new expansion called In the Beginning, which adds another 18 puzzles to solve on the original game and its first DLC release. Narratively, In the Beginning is a prequel to the events of the first game, but what makes it special is that 16 out of the 18 puzzles were made in collaboration with members of the community who had been making their own puzzles for the last 11 years. The result is an expansion that is so tough, the puzzles included with In the Beginning are earning the reputation as being some of the most challenging to solve in the entire series. This guide will show you how to solve the Blocker puzzle in the expansion. If you just want a hint, then all I'll say is to leave the jammer alone. It's already doing everything you need it to do. Keep reading if you want the full solution. When you enter the puzzle area and look around, it won't take you long to deduce that you need a second connector to deactivate the shield blocking the way to the tetromino. It's easy to assume that the jammer you see on the right side of the area deactivating a shield between the two spaces is part of the solve. As I said in the hint, you don't need it at all, and you can leave it where it is, keeping the shield in the wall between the two sides of the puzzle area down. Instead, what you need to do first, is get the hexahedron.
