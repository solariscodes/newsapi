EA has announced that throughout May, more players will be invited to its Battlefield Labs playtesting, and will begin to invite players from select regions of Asia, now that the Battlefield teams have "wrapped up our initial server performance and stability concerns." The development update recapped what the playtest has accomplished so far, which, according to EA, includes "Establishing a solid foundation for smooth, low-latency and high-performance gunplay. Finding the right balance in movement speed for functionality such as crouch sprint, combat rolling, and vaulting as part of our combat pacing initiatives. Using destruction to create fun and lasting tactical gameplay across rounds and experiences." That's not to say EA won't continue to balance and tweak the playtest, especially since it also confirmed that there will be new content added as it begins to scale up the playtesting with the addition of more players across North America and Europe. "Now that we've wrapped up initial server performance and stability concerns," the blog post reads, "we've validated a solid foundation for a core Battlefield experience. We're now ready to continue scaling Battlefield Labs testing globally." "Throughout May, we'll be inviting more players across Europe and North America, and will start to include select areas of Asia. Alongside testing new content, we'll continue to iterate on our initial focus areas, such as balancing the different weapon archetypes and damage values, as well as movement and combat pacing mechanics." So, if you've not yet been invited to the playtest for the next Battlefield game, then it's worth it to keep trying this month, as you might have a better chance at being invited. The last development update we got on Battlefield Labs showcased EA's new approach to destruction, which looked a lot like the old approach it had back when Battlefield was the biggest competition Call of Duty had.
