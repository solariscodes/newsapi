Plus: build Blathers' Museum from Animal Crossing. Nintendo's partnership with Lego is continuing this summer with a fresh wave of Super Mario and Animal Crossing sets, including the first appearance of some fan-favourite characters. In Nintendo's general Super Mario range, you'll be able to add Captain Toad via a new playset featuring the intrepid explorer at his campsite. Very cute. The Mario Kart range, meanwhile, adds an interactive Lego Mario and Standard Kart set, as well as a set containing Wario and King Boo (thanks, Jay's Brick Blog). Other Mario sets include a Toad House and a Bowser's Castle playset. For those looking to splash a bit more cash, there's a 1251-piece Prince Florian and Castle Bowser set inspired by Super Mario Wonder to tempt you. Three more Lego sets also join the Animal Crossing range, bringing a pair of houses with villagers Fuschia, Stitches and Fang, plus a further house with Goldie. But the star of the show here is clearly Blathers' Museum, a 543-piece set that features the building's facade, as well as a fountain and dinosaur skeleton exhibit. Oh, and Blathers himself of course, hoo. All of the above sets are due to go on sale from 1st August, with pre-orders live shortly via Lego.com. Anything take your fancy? Further down the line, Lego has already announced a Game Boy set due later in 2025, and a full Lego Pok√©mon range that's coming in 2026.
