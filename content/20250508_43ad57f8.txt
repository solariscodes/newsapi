"We appreciate all of your support." Evil Dead: The Game is being removed from sale on PC, PlayStation and Xbox, publisher Saber Interactive has announced. The multiplayer horror game's online servers will remain online for the time being for those who have bought and played Evil Dead: The Game already, Saber continued, but no new players will now be able to join. Launched in May 2022, today's announcement comes just ahead of Evil Dead: The Game's third anniversary. But development on new content for the game had already ceased, and a planned port for Nintendo Switch was scrapped. "We can confirm we've begun the process of removing the game from digital storefronts," Saber wrote in a statement on Evil Dead: The Game's Steam page. "Anyone who has purchased the game will still be able to play it as we plan to keep our servers online for everyone. "We want to extend a sincere thank you to our community, to those who have been part of the game from the very beginning, and those who have recently joined us. We appreciate all of your support." Evil Dead: The Game is an asymmetrical multiplayer game featuring characters from the Evil Dead movies, including Bruce Campbell's Ash Williams, facing off against the Deadite hordes. The project was supported by additional maps, modes, classes and characters, though this soon fizzled out as it became clear the game had not found enough of an audience. "Evil Dead: The Game works best when it allows you to be the demon, which also means allowing you to be the director," Christian Donlan wrote, saying it reflected the franchise's films better than expected. "Gimme some sugar, baby."
