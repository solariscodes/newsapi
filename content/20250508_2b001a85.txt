The ongoing legal battle between Nintendo and Pocketpair--creators of indie hit Palworld--has already seen the developer make a big change to Palworld's world through the removal of the Pal Sphere. Today, Pocketpair has announced another "compromise" via its next update, which will remove the ability to glide with a Pal--now, gliding will require a separate glider item. The official Pocketpair account on X announced the coming update, and that the change was a direct result of continued legal proceedings with Nintendo. The post refers to the decision as "disappointing," but also "necessary in order to prevent further disruptions to the development of Palworld." [Regarding the lawsuit, changes to Palworld and the future]We would like to express our sincere gratitude and appreciation for the continued support of our fans over the past few months. We apologize for not being able to share as much information as we would like, but we trustâ€¦ "Furthermore, we regret to inform our players that with the implementation of Patch v0.5.5, we must make yet another compromise," the post reads. Pocketpair did say that Pals would still give passive buffs to gliding, and that they "remain committed to developing Palworld and delivering exciting new content to our fans." Nintendo sued Pocketpair in September 2024, while releasing a statement that the company was seeking "an injunction against infringement and compensation for damages on the grounds that Palworld, a game developed and released by the Defendant, infringes multiple patent rights." Nintendo is also seeking payments totaling five million yen to both Nintendo and The Pokemon Company for the alleged infringement. Palworld is available now for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, and PC.
