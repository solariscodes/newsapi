A new Final Fantasy VII Rebirth mod that's now available for download for free introduces a highly requested feature that is only available in a limited capacity in the vanilla game. The Dresscode mod developed by YIIS, which can be downloaded from Nexus Mods, introduces a system that lets users change character outfits and weapons in-game dynamically. The tool not only supports all the base game outfits, requiring another mod to unlock those not normally available via the changing booth, but also modded outfits, of which quite a few are available online. Before downloading the mod, you can check it out in action in the video below. Though the Final Fantasy VII Rebirth modding scene is not as big as that of other titles, plenty of great mods have been developed since the game's PC launch early this year. While the first few mods were, unsurprisingly, on the simple side, the unofficial additions made to the second entry in the remake trilogy have gradually become better and better, and have gone as far as adding completely new playable characters, such as the Turks Rude and Reno. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can learn more about one of the best role-playing games released this generation by checking out Kai's review.
