A DOOM 3 Unreal Engine 5.5 fan-made remake is in development, and it's looking great with some advanced visual features in a new video shared online this week. The fan-made remake of the third main entry in the series by id Software is being worked on by Fran√ßois Montagud, who shared a look at the latest version of the remake in a new video. The new version of the remake, which is sadly not available for download publicly, features reworked visual and gameplay aspects to enhance the game's atmosphere and tension. These reworked features include improved dynamic lighting and FX, more reactive AI behaviors, updated shooting system with better visual feedback, reworked sound effects, and more. While far from perfect, it's undeniable how this tech demo gets a lot of things right, and some of its elements are downright impressive, such as the smoke behavior with the dead enemy at the 2:20 mark. While the DOOM 3 Unreal Engine 5.5. remake cannot be played right now, fans of the id Software series will soon be able to enjoy a new entry in the series with DOOM: The Dark Ages, which is launching next week on PC and consoles. The next entry in the series promises to be another excellent action-packed first-person shooter, as highlighted by Chris in his hands-on preview. Combine this more open approach with the excellent fast-paced combat from DOOM Eternal, where you will be finishing off enemies to have extra life and ammo fall out of their bodies, combos and well-timed attacks being rewarded with more to keep you going, and you have a recipe for greatness. It's even better to use new weapons, like the shield saw, in an enjoyable combination of attacks that makes you feel like the DOOM Slayer in overdrive.
