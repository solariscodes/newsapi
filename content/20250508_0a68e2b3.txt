Microsoft has secured another victory over the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in its quest to secure Activision Blizzard. The FTC’s appeal to block Microsoft’s $69 billion deal to acquire the company behind Call of Duty was denied by San Francisco’s 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals today, further cementing a purchase that was originally announced in late 2022 (via Reuters). It was a move decided by a three-judge panel that brought an end to the FTC’s questioning of the July 2023 decision to allow Microsoft to finalize its purchase. Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard has faced scrutiny from across the board for more than three years. Select U.S. Senators were among the first to oppose the transaction, bringing up concerns of the ongoing consolidation of the tech industry as the Xbox maker brought in more major companies under its wing. As competitors and gamers alike grew concerned an acquisition meant popular franchises like Call of Duty would no longer launch on competing platforms, Microsoft confirmed it had no interest in barring certain franchises behind lengthy exclusivity periods. While challenges continued to arise throughout 2023, Microsoft was finally able to complete its purchase of Activision Blizzard in October of that same year. The FTC’s appeal could have presented a late roadblock to continuing operations as normal, and now that its efforts have failed, it seems its pursuit is finally over.
