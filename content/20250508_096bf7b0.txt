Holy calamity! Bear witness to a Zelda show-off by Michael McWhertor A Japanese player has already crossed beating The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild on Nintendo Switch 2 off the list. YouTuber and speedrunner Ikaboze managed that feat this past weekend at Nintendo Switch 2 Experience: Tokyo, where attendees had a chance to go hands on with Nintendo’s next-gen console. Like other attendees, Ikaboze was limited to 10 minutes of playtime on Switch 2, but he managed to see Breath of the Wild’s credits in about seven minutes. Granted, Ikaboze wasn’t starting from scratch and pulled off a heretofore unseen seven-minute Any% speedrun of Breath of the Wild — the current record is just shy of 23 minutes, utilizing glitches. Ikaboze had access to a handful of save files at Nintendo Switch 2 Experience: Tokyo, one of which has a well-equipped Link that puts him right outside of Hyrule Castle. He makes quick work of Calamity Ganon. At certain points in the video, Ikaboze tries (and fails) to pull off the game’s windbomb technique, which can launch Link high into the air and let him paraglide to far away locations. But that technique hasn’t been removed or fixed in the Switch 2 version of Breath of the Wild; as seen later in the video, Ikaboze is able to pull off a windbomb jump after he rolls credits on the game with his remaining allotted time. Your chance to beat The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild on Switch 2 is coming on June 5, when both the game and Nintendo’s next-gen console launch. A Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom launches the same day. The best way to stay up to date on all things Nintendo Switch 2.
