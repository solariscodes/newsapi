It might be 8 years old*, but Mario Kart 8 Deluxe continues to sell like it's a brand-new game for Switch. Case in point: The racing game sold 6.23 million copies for Nintendo's last fiscal year (April 1, 2024-March 31, 2025). That brings lifetime sales of the title to 68.20 million units. For comparison's sake, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe sold more than two newer Switch releases combined for Nintendo's last fiscal year--The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom and Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door. The former saw the Hylian princess as the protagonist and sold 4.09 million copies since launching in September. Meanwhile, the Mario RPG remake has sold 2.10 million units after arriving almost a year ago on May 23, 2024. Now Playing: Mario Kart 8 Deluxe - Official 96 Courses Showcase Trailer Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is Nintendo's best-selling game of all time, if Wii Sports isn't treated as a standalone game. That minigame collection that focused on motion controls, though, was packed in with Wii hardware in all major markets outside of Japan. The next-closest Switch games in sales rankings are Animal Crossing: New Horizons at 47.82 million copies and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate at 36.24 million units. Zooming out, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is the fifth-best-selling game of all time when combining sales with the original Mario Kart 8 release on Wii U. The racing title only trails Tetris, Minecraft, Grand Theft Auto V, and Wii Sports--in that order. What could slow down Mario Kart 8 Deluxe going forward is Mario Kart World. The first brand-new console entry in the franchise in over a decade will launch June 5 alongside the Switch 2 system. *Mario Kart 8 launched on Wii U in 2014.
