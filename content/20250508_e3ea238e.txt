Getting Cyberpunk 2077 to run on Nintendo Switch 2 did not require a gigantic effort, although getting it to play well was among the challenges CD Projekt Red had to face during the port's development. Speaking with The Game Business, CD Projekt Red SVP of Business Jan Rosner revealed that the team managed to get the game running on Nintendo Switch 2 fairly quickly and without a gigantic effort. However, bigger challenges were to ensure the game would play well, use some of the Nintendo Switch 2's unique features, and that it suited the handheld format. With the game's disastrous launch on previous generation consoles in mind, CDPR wanted to ensure the game played well on the system, even with some visual compromises that, according to Rosner, don't impact the game's artistic vision. In this regard, the CDPR SVP of Business feels the team achieved their goal of having a big AAA RPG on the go playable from start to finish without making any significant compromises. The attention CD Projekt Red placed on the Nintendo Switch 2 release of Cyberpunk 2077 and the console's audience is well highlighted by the fact that the retail edition will include the full game on the cartridge and won't require any additional download. The team made this decision based on their experience with The Witcher 3 on the original Switch, which proved how important physical editions are for the Nintendo audience, and, as such, putting the entire game on the cartridge to offer a plug-and-play experience was the right thing to do. Cyberpunk 2077 launches on Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5th, the same day the console debuts worldwide, with a few exceptions. The game is also available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, and Xbox One.
