Besides confirming the official release date for Mafia: The Old Country, publisher 2K and developer Hangar 13 released a new trailer for the game, which provides a good look at the gameplay, which does away with the open-world mechanics of previous entries in the series in favor of a more linear, story-driven experience. The developers will provide more information on the game later today during a PAX East panel. Once available, both the trailer and the panel can be watched below. Mafia: The Old Country launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on August 8th. The game will also be available via the GeForce NOW streaming service at launch.
