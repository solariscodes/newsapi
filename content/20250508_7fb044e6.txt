Grand Theft Auto 6's new trailer reached 475 million views since its release on Tuesday, Rockstar Games has confirmed. The company confirmed this to The Hollywood Reporter, saying it's the biggest debut for a trailer for anything ever, surpassing the 365 million views that Deadpool & Wolverine clocked in its first 24 hours. As of May 8, the GTA 6 trailer on Rockstar's YouTube page alone had more than 86 million views, but the 475 million tally counts views across networks and platforms. GTA 6 is one of the most-anticipated games of all time, and it's expected to sell 40 million copies in its first year. The game was originally due to launch in Fall 2025 before being delayed to 2026. The new trailer used the song "Hot Together" by The Pointer Sisters, and like Tom Petty's "Love Is A Long Road" before it, streams of the song are way, way up. Spotify said streams of the song increased by 182,000% since the trailer debut, compared to a surge of 37,000 for the Petty song back in 2023.
