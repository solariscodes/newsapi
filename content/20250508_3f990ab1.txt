Split Fiction has had a "hugely successful launch" according to EA, as the latest co-op adventure from Hazelight Studios nears 4 million copies sold. The game was highlighted by EA in its wrap-up report for its 2025 fiscal year, and counted as a key part of what led to a "strong finish" for the year alongside EA Sports FC 25. Hazelight Studios followed up the news from the financial report with a post on its official X account, saying "4 million sold! So many of you have picked up Split Fiction already, it's amazing...Seeing the fun you have with our game and the love you show for Mio, Zoe and each other warms our hearts here at Hazelight. And so many hot dogs made..." Hazelight's previous title and game of the year winner in 2021, It Takes Two, surpassed 20 million copies sold in March 2025. Split Fiction has a long way to go to reach that milestone, but it certainly seems like it's on its way there. Just last week, we learned that the previously announced Split Fiction movie will star Sydney Sweeney as one of the two female leads. It's not yet known which of the two she will play or who will join her as a co-star. Wicked director Jon M. Chu has signed on to direct the adaptation, with Deadpool & Wolverine writers Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese penning the script. Along with confirming the sales milestone for Split Fiction, EA's wrap-up report for its 2025 fiscal year confirmed that the next Battlefield game will be revealed this summer and that it will release sometime before April 2026. The next Skate game is also set to release during that same period.
