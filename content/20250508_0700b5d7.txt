NVIDIA announced today that the whole Mafia franchise is coming to GeForce NOW. This includes the classic titles, the remakes and remasters, and even the upcoming Mafia: The Old Country game, which will be available on the cloud platform at launch on August 8. Here's the full list of GeForce NOW games added this week: On this GeForce NOW list, our David Carcasole has just reviewed Revenge of the Savage Planet, which he found funny, beautiful, and yet tedious: Ultimately, Revenge of the Savage Planet is a fun mix of sharp satire and toilet humor, with a layer of environmental systems that do work well together, once you have the upgrades to manipulate and use them all. It thrives mostly due to the charm, care, and whimsy pumped into its design and nearly every aspect, but it lacks any narrative chops to push it further. Tedious missions and a poorly executed gameplay arc dampen the experience, potentially to the point where I wouldn't blame you for putting it down. But if you're charmed by the parts of Revenge of the Savage Planet that are working overtime to charm you, then it's worth sticking around for what can be a fun romp. Especially if you have a friend by your side, as it's easy to see how much more fun it would be to play this game in co-op.
