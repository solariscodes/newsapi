While the wide adoption of the Nintendo Switch 2 system is the priority for Nintendo, the Japanese company may increase the system's price depending on the tariffs. Following the latest financial report for the previous fiscal year, as reported by Yahoo Japan, Nintendo's president Shuntaro Furukawa highlighted how the company's priority regarding the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 is to quickly make the system popular, and, as such, there will be an increase in advertising and promotion expenses for the company which contributes, alongside the system's low profit margins, to an estimated operating profit increase of only 13%. According to Furukawa-san, a profit increase will require an increase in software purchased per hardware unit, which may not be that difficult to achieve, considering the solid launch lineup. If the company's plans for the Nintendo Switch 2 launch are clear, the future seems more uncertain, primarily due to the tariffs imposed by the United States, which have influenced the forecast for the fiscal year, based on the condition that they remain the same. Tariffs are considered a cost when determining the price of the system in any country or region, Furukawa-san said, and if the tariffs change significantly over the current assumptions, the system's price could be increased after evaluating various factors. In previous console generations, consoles getting cheaper was a pretty safe assumption, but the current console generation has shown how times have profoundly changed. With both the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X now being more expensive than at launch in most of the world, it really wouldn't be surprising to see the Nintendo Switch 2 see a price increase after its launch window has passed, and Nintendo fulfilled its goal of making the system as popular as possible in that timeframe.
