In the weeks immediately following its release, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has earned itself a lot of accolades. It's already sold two million copies, achieved the almost unheard of feats of its physical copies selling out and beating its own Steam concurrent player count in its second week, it now has the best user scores on both Metacritic and the PlayStation Store, and it has achieved acclaim from both revered Japanese developers and the French president. Not bad for your studio's first game. A life to dream, hey. The long list of achievements doesn't end there, though, as Clair Obscur now has higher Steam review ratings than many of its JRPG contemporaries. Before we start, yes, I'm aware Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 isn't a JRPG. Its style and inspirations, though, are very much of JRPG nature, and thus, it deserves to be compared against them, so I will. Over the last few days, according to SteamDB, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has risen to 92.52 percent positive reviews on Steam. It sits with "Very Positive" reviews, but more impressively, scores higher than many, many JRPG franchises. On Steam, the highest-rated Final Fantasy game is Final Fantasy 9, with 92.2 percent positive reviews. The original Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy 7 are the only other games from the mainline series to have achieved over 90 percent, scoring 91.54 and 90.88 percent, respectively. Final Fantasy 7 Remake sits at 87.13 percent positive, while last year's Rebirth is at 75.96.

Although there are only a couple of mainline Dragon Quest games on Steam, Clair Obscur topples them both, with Dragon Quest 3: HD-2D Remake sitting at 72.71 percent, and Dragon Quest XI S: Echoes of an Elusive Age sitting at 90.62 percent. Chrono Trigger sits at 85.83 percent, Legend of Mana at 75.08, Octopath Traveler and Octopath Traveler 2 at 84.11 and 92.4 percent respectively, and Metaphor ReFantazio at 89.24 percent. In the coming days, it will overtake Yakuza: Like A Dragon's 92.52 percent, and it already has Infinite Wealth's 89.57 beat. The only series that truly has Clair Obscur's number is Persona. Persona 3 Reload sits at 92.63, Persona 5 Royal at 95,18, and Persona 4 Golden at 95.43. There's still a way to go before Expedition 33 conquers those. You have to imagine that in its wildest dreams, Sandfall Interactive could never have foreseen the level of critical and audience acclaim that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 continues to receive.

Verso can make surprisingly good use of Base Attacks with the right setup in Clair Obscur. Simon says, parry. Or else. The Chromatic Troubadour may seem goofy, but their whimsy is only outmatched by their danger. Where have you been? While the expedition is for those who come after, what about the ones who came before?
