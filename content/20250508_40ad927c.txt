The Talos Principle: Reawakened remastered the original game and its Road to Gehenna DLC in Unreal Engine 5, but it also added something completely new to the classic puzzle game. A brand new expansion called In the Beginning, which added 18 new puzzles for players to solve, and was a narrative prequel to the original game. What makes In the Beginning particularly special, is that 16 out of the 18 puzzles included in the expansion were actually made in collaboration with members of the community who had been making their own levels for the last decade. It's a special inclusion, that also solves the mystery of why the In the Beginning puzzles are some of the most difficult ones to solve across the entire Talos Principle series. They're puzzles for hardcore veterans, made by hardcore veterans. This guide will show you how to solve the Parabolic Interference puzzle. If you only want a hint before getting the full solution, then what I'll say is you need to make two laser webs, not one big one. For the full solution, read on.
