Nintendo has predicted how many Switch 2 consoles it expects to sell during its 2026 financial year, which will cover the first 10 months of the hybrid gaming console when it hits the market on June 5. According to Nintendo's results for the full financial year that ended on March 31, it's forecasting that it'll sell 15 million Switch 2 consoles and 45 million games. This would put it close to the sales figures of the original Switch console, which launched in March 2017 and reached 17.79 million sales globally during its first 13 months. It's also worth noting that Nintendo is predicting that the Switch 2 will reach its sales goal in 10 months. There are other elements to consider as well--like the Switch 2 having a higher MSRP of $450 for the base model--but the company has factored in US president Donald Trump's tariff rates for its sales. In Japan, demand has outstripped supply as Nintendo says preorders that side have exceeded its expectations.
